# Testing different elements

This is a test of different elements. What happens, to a [link](https://github.com/svbrodersen/mySite).
What happens when that link is instead to a static file [link](/static/img/SVG-Loaders-master/README.md).
And how about if that link is to an image? ![This is an
image](/static/img/login_image.jpg).

And what about the following code snippet:

```lua
dev = function()
 hi = "Hello"
end
```

And some python code:

```python
import numpy as np
a = np.arange(0, 100)
print(a)
```
